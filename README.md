# Natours-Project
Code along project to learn advanced CSS tricks and learn about Sass

Instead of following the course instructor, which used absolute positioning to create the entire layout, I went with a flexbox solution
to learn and to see if I could 100% replicate the look. In my opinion, flexbox is also a lot easier to create a page layout like this but
in some places I couldn't avoid absolute positioning (which is still a valid way to position things and doesn't have to be avoided) 
and still used for smaller elements and was such.
